# Overview

In this section we have three sections:

1. Scanning Python packages stored in Code Commit repositories
2. Scanning Code Artifact domains for python packages
3. Scanning Dockerfiles stored in ECR

Each section has its own set of prerequisities and can be performed individually without any dependencies on other sections. You can either choose to do all sections or a specific section to your liking.

All code resources referenced are available <a href="https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-modernization-with-snyk-security">here</a> under the `workshop-resources` folder.c
